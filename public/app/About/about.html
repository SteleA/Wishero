<h2>
  Everyone has dreams and wishes.
</h2>

<p>
  There is a saying that goes, if you know what you want, write it down and you will get your wish in one way or another.
</p>

<h4>
  Who is Wishero for?
</h4>

<p>
  We wanted to create a space to share wishes with close and dear ones. A place that is easily accessible by people that care about you.
</p>

<h4>
  Giving gifts that people want
</h4>

<p>
  Buying a gift for someone can be a bit tricky. You don't want to ruin the surprise by asking.  Make it right on the first try and give something meaningful.
</p>

<h4>
  Arenâ€™t there other apps like Wishero?
</h4>

<p>
  We tried out the most popular wishlist apps. The alternatives we found felt out of date and hard to use. Wishero is supposed to be clean, fun and easy to use no matter if you're a computer genius or a beginner.
</p>

<h4>
  Have ideas?
</h4>

<p>
  We build this for you to enjoy. If you have any ideas for improvement you can reach out on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/_wishero" class="link" target="blank">@_wishero</a>) or clicking the feedback link in the top right dropdown menu.
</p>

<p>
  We hope all your dreams will come true!<br>
